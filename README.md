# config

**Config** is a basic checklist I follow to set up a new development environment. It gets me up to speed with vim, so I can more quickly get back to coding.

## Contents

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.vimrc` | Customizes the VIM. |
| `.gitconfig` | Global Git configuration to specify my name and email, shortcuts, colors, and more. |
| `.gitignore` | The ignore file from [twbs/bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) that I use everywhere. |

## Checklist



## Use it yourself

Fork this repo, or just copy-paste things you need, and make it your own. **Please be sure to change your `.gitconfig` name and email address though!**
